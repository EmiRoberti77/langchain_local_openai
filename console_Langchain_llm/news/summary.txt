The retail sector in the UK:
definition and statistics
1.1 Definition of the retail sector
The retail sector includes any business or individual involved with selling
products directly to consumers. The retail sector includes shops,
department stores, supermarkets, market stalls, door-to-door sales
people and internet retailers.
Related sectors include the wholesale sector (which supplies retailers),
the logistics sector (which connects wholesalers and producers with
retailers), and the manufacturing sector (which produces the products
sold by retailers). This briefing paper focuses on the retail sector only.
1
Retail stores are an important part of high streets and town centres.
However, it is important to note that the retail industry is broader than
just sales on the high street. The statistics in this briefing represent the
whole retail sector including in shopping centres, retail parks and online
sales.
For further discussion about high streets, see our briefing: Town centre
regeneration (21 May 2021).
1.2 Economic contribution of the retail sector
Summary:
• Retail sector economic output was £97.0 billion in 2020, 5.0% of
the UK’s total economic output and a 2.5% fall on 2019.
2
• There were 3.0 million jobs in the retail sector in 2019.3
• There were 310,000 retail businesses as of 1 January 2020.
4
Economic output
The economic output of the retail sector in 2020 was £97.0 billion,
which was 5.2% of the UK’s total economic output.
5
Retail sector economic output fell by 2.5% in 2020 compared to 2019
following the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
The economic output of the sector returned to pre-pandemic levels by
the end of 2020. Output fell again in the first quarter (Q1) of 2021 to

impacts across different types of retail stores – discussed further in
section 2.

Over the past ten years, the retail sector’s economic output has largely
followed a similar path to the whole economy.
The retail sector saw a fall in economic output and then weak growth
following the financial crisis and subsequent recession of 2008, until
late 2012. In 2013, the sector began to recover and grew strongly from
2014 until late 2016.
1.3 Employment
Employment in the retail sector in the UK was around 3.0 million in
2019, 9.3% of the UK total. This was a fall of 11,100 (0.4%) compared
to 2018 (over the same period, total employment in the UK grew by
1%).6
Employment in the retail sector is fairly evenly distributed across most
regions and countries of the UK, shown in the following chart.
London had the lowest proportion of retail employment in 2019 (7.5%
of jobs in London were in retail) and Northern Ireland had the highest
(11.5%). The South West and North East also had around 11% of
employment in retail.

Impact of the pandemic on retail employment
According to the Centre for Retail Research, an academic-led research
institute, 109,407 retail jobs could be affected by retail companies
going into administration in 2020.
7 This figure is higher than the Centre
reported for 2008 following the financial crisis. The Guardian also kept
track of job losses announced across a number of high street brands
during the course of 2020, the largest being 13,000 redundancies
across Arcadia (brands such as Top Shop, Dorothy Perkins and Miss
Selfidge) and 12,000 redundancies at Debenhams.8
As of 31 March 2021, 536,300 retail jobs were on furlough under the
Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which makes 19% of eligible jobs in
the sector.9 Over half of these (56%) were in ‘other specialised stores’
which includes clothing and footwear stores.
1.4 Businesses
There were 310,120 retail businesses in UK retail sector as of 1 January
2020, 5.2% of all businesses.10
7 Centre for Retail Research, Who’s gone bust?, accessed 25 May2021.. Note that
some of the business that went into receivership may have recovered, been sold as
going concerns but changed their name, or ceased to exist. Therefore, these figures

8 Retail sector in the UK
In common with most other sectors in the economy, small and medium
sized enterprises (SMEs) made up over 99% of retail businesses.
However, the retail sector and the whole economy had differing
proportions of businesses in other business size categories.
• 59% of businesses in the retail sector had 0 employees (single
person-led business), compared with 76% in the economy as a
whole.
• 35% of businesses in the retail sector had between 1 and 10
employees, compared with 19% in the whole economy
• 6% of retail businesses had between 10 and 100 employees,
compared with 4% of all businesses.

2. Retail sales in Great Britain
In 2020, retail sales in the Great Britain were worth £437 billion, down
0.6% on 2019. For every pound spent in 2020:
• 41 pence was spent in food shops – a 7% rise on 2019
• 9 pence was spent in clothing shops (including textiles and
footwear) – a 25% fall on 2019
• 8 pence was spent on automotive fuel – a 25% fall on 2019
• 8 pence was spent in household goods shops (including
electronics and furniture stores) – a 1% rise on 2019
The remainder was spent in other types of shops, non-specialist shops,
or in non-store retailing, such as market stores, catalogues and onlineonly retailers.11
Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, the volume of retail sales had been
increasing year-on-year since 2013. This followed a period of stalled
growth in sales following the financial crisis, between 2008 and 2013.
The following chart shows how the volume of retail sales has changed
over the last two decades (that is, sales adjusted for inflation).12 Only
rarely have retail sales fallen in volume terms compared to the previous
year since 1997. Average growth in rolling three month periods
compared to the previous year was 2.0% between 1997 and 2021.

10 Retail sector in the UK
Coronavirus pandemic: impact on sales
At the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020, retail sales fell
dramatically as lockdown restrictions closed non-essential retail stores.
Retail sales as a whole recovered to pre-pandemic levels by June 2020 –
relatively quickly compared to other sectors such as hospitality and
entertainment.13 Sales fell again in January and February 2021 when
non-essential retail shut again, however the fall was much less
significant than early 2020, suggesting that retailers and consumers had
adapted to restrictions.
Although retail sales overall have broadly returned to pre-pandemic
levels, there has been a big difference between the impact on different
store types, shown in the chart below.
Notes: all retail includes sale of fuel.
Source: ONS, Retail Sales Index, Series J5EK, EAPT, EAPX, EAPY, J5DZ, accessed 21 May
2021.
Food stores have maintained a steady level of sales throughout the
pandemic, with sales increasing during lockdown periods as consumers
relied on groceries rather than eating out, for example. Household
goods stores saw sales increase above pre-pandemic levels during the
summer of 2020, thought to be driven by sales of DIY products for
home improvements.14 Clothing stores have been the hardest hit during
the pandemic. Sales in clothing stores remained below pre-pandemic
levels throughout 2020 and early 2021. Sales in clothing stores
recovered to pre-pandemic levels in April 2021, following strong growth
as non-essential retail re-opened that month.

Chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, Helen Dickinson said
that fashion sales in knit and outerwear were particularly strong in April
as customers prepared to meet friends and family outdoors.15 She said
that although April sales were strong and a “step in the right direction”
demand remained fragile with footfall in stores still below pre-pandemic
levels and staff remaining on furlough (see section 1.3).16
Non-store and online sales
Non-store sales increased rapidly at the onset of the pandemic and have
remained high ever since: as of April 2021, non-store sales were 53%
above pre-pandemic levels. Non-store sales mean retail without a
physical store presence; 82% of this category is online-only retail and
the remainder market stalls, catalogue-order retail, pop-up stores etc.
Similarly, the proportion of all retail sales happening online increased
significantly in March 2020, shown in the chart below. These figures
include all online retail sales including for retailers with physical stores,
such as online supermarket orders for example. Internet sales have been
above 28% of all sales since April 2020, up from 20% before the
pandemic. February 2021 saw a record high for internet sales, forming
36% of all retail sales. Online sales fell as a proportion of all retail in
April 2021 but remained high at 29% of all retail sales even as nonessential stores opened. Online retail is discussed further in section 3.2
of this briefing.

3. Pressures on the retail sector
The retail sector has changed radically in recent years. Factors driving
these changes include internet retailing, store closures and other
changes on the high street, and an increasing consumer preference for
large multi-purpose malls.
This section includes a discussion of challenges facing the retail sector.
For a discussion of wider challenges facing high streets and town
centres, including on business rates, see the Commons Library briefing:
Town centre regeneration (21 May 2021).
3.1 Coronavirus pandemic
The coronavirus pandemic has caused huge challenges for the retail
industry. Section 2 covers the impact of the pandemic on sales, showing
the different experiences of different retail sectors during the pandemic
and section 3.3 below covers store closures.
Even stores that have seen sales remain strong or increase, such as food
stores, have had new challenges due to social distancing requirements
and the costs of implementing Covid-secure measures. The sector has
benefited from a number of Government financial support schemes
during the pandemic (Box 1).
Box 1: Support for the retail sector during the pandemic
The retail sector has benefited from Government support schemes during the pandemic, including:
• Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS): up to 31 March 2021, employers in the wholesale and
retail sector had claimed £11.27 billion under the (CJRS).
17
• Government-backed business loans: wholesale and retail sector businesses were offered loans
worth £10.95 billion in total, 18% of the total loaned across all sectors. Wholesale and retail
businesses represent 9% of the total business population.
18
• Business rates relief: retail businesses in England received 100% business rates relief in 2020/21.
The business rates holiday will continue to 30 June 2021 and will then be replaced with 66%
relief from 1 July to 31 March 2022 (with a cap depending on whether the business could open
during the winter lockdown).
19 The devolved administrations also have business rates relief
schemes.20
• A series of small business grants. As one example, in 2021/22 in England, qualifying nonessential retail businesses may receive restart grants up to £6,000 per premises.
21 The devolved
administrations have separate grant schemes.22
For a summary of all Government support schemes, see our briefing, Coronavirus: economic impact
(section 4.3).

13 Commons Library Briefing, 25 May 2021
The pandemic has also accelerated some pre-existing trends and
challenges facing the retail sector discussed further in this section, such
as increased online shopping.
New challenges and opportunities have also emerged due to new
behaviours during the lockdown, such as from increased home working
and restrictions on travel. For example, the Local Data Company, PwC
and others suggested a trend towards local shopping emerged during
the pandemic, with local stores and smaller villages/towns seeing better
footfall performance compared to city centres (see section 1.4 of our
briefing, Town centre regeneration for further discussion).
Chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, Helen Dickinson said
that although April 2021 sales were strong, consumer demand and the
continued recovery of the sector remained fragile.23 She described
pointed to facing the sector going forward, in particular the end of
business rates relief (see Box 1).
Another major concern facing the sector following the pandemic is
accumulated rent debt.24 The Government introduced a moratorium on
evictions due to non-payment of rent for business tenancies (in England)
that is due to expire on 30 June 2021.
25 Section 11 of the Commons
Library briefing Coronavirus: Support for businesses provides further
information.
3.2 Internet retailing
Shopping on the internet has become increasingly popular and this is
transforming the retail sector.
As shown in section 2 above, online retail sales have increased from
around 5% of all retail sales in 2008 (when the ONS data series began)
to around 20% in 2019. At the onset of the coronavirus pandemic,
online sales have increased to over 28% since March 2020.
The popularity of buying goods via the internet varies by type of shop,
shown in the chart below. Department stores and clothing stores have a
higher proportion of online sales compared to food stores.
All store types saw big increases in online orders in 2020. The
proportions of internet sales had been previously increasing year-onyear to 2020 but to a smaller degree.
Michael Saunders, a member of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy
Committee reported that small retailers (with employment less than 100
people) have a relatively high market share in online sales and have seen
a larger increase in online sales compared to larger retailers, at 17.4%
year-on-year growth in Q4 2020 compared to 1.7% growth for larger
retailers.26

3.3 Shop closures
In 2020, 54 retail companies with multiple stores ceased trading,
affecting 5,214 stores and 109,407 jobs according to the Centre for
Retail Research.28 This is the highest number of store closures reported
by the Centre since 2008 and 2009 following the financial crisis.
The Centre described the period 2020–2021 as “one of the worst
periods for bricks-and-mortar retailing since the 1970s”, predicting
further store closures and 200,000 job losses for the sector in 2021.29
Further information on the companies in administration is provided on
the Centre’s website. The Guardian also kept track of job losses
announced across a number high street brands during the course of
2020.30
Source: Centre for Retail Research, Who's gone bust in retail; *up to April 2021
Prior to the pandemic the sector was already experiencing challenges
from store closures. From 2008 to the end of 2019, the retail sector
with the most stores affected by company failures has been the clothing
sector, accounting for 27% of all stores affected. Off licences accounted
for 15% of stores affected. Footwear stores and DVD music and video
game rental stores each accounted for 12% of stores affected.31
The Centre summarised the challenges in the retail sector leading to
store closures as follows:

some of the business that went into receivership may have recovered, been sold as

should be used cautiously. They should not be interpreted to mean that this many

• The high costs of running retail outlets, including rents,
business rates and high labour costs;
• Low profitability caused by high costs, slow growth in sales,
squeezed profit margins and heavy price competition;
• The rapid growth of online competition such that by 2018
online sales accounted for around 18.4% of total retail
merchandise sales, with much of online growth achieved at
the expense of bricks-and-mortar retailers.
• Lack of preparation: low investment in stores and weak
forward planning to meet the challenges of the new
retailing.32
The Centre described the coronavirus lockdowns and ongoing social
distancing costs as “trumping all the above”.
Empty shops
The Local Data Company (LDC, a retail and leisure data company)
collects information on retail and leisure businesses in town centres in
Great Britain. The LDC reported that the rate of vacant retail units has
increased from 12% to 15% from 2018 to 2020.33
The year of 2020 saw the biggest increase in retail vacancies since 2013.
The Local Data Company has forecast that vacancy rates will continue to
rise in high streets, shopping centres and retail parks in 2021 as the full
impact of the pandemic has not yet been seen.

vacancies in shopping centres are much higher and vacancies in retail
parks are much lower.35
Retail parks have been the most resilient to store closures during the
pandemic, thought to be due to outdoor environments and accessibility
by car as well as a higher presence of essential retailers at these
locations. Shopping centres have been the most impacted by the
pandemic in terms of store closures, thought to be due to indoor
environments and low proportions of essential retail compared to retail
parks and high streets.
36 Shopping centres have the highest proportion
of long-term vacancies, with 5% of units vacant for more than three
years, compared to 4.2% on high streets and 1.9% in retail parks.37
Vacancy rates by region
The following chart shows retail and leisure vacancies by region in 2019
and 2020 as reported by the Local Data Company. The chart includes
vacancies in shopping centres, high streets and retail parks. Leisure units
include restaurants, bars, gyms, hairdressers etc.
London had the lowest rate of vacancies, with 10% of retail and leisure
properties vacant in 2020. The North East had the highest proportion of
vacant units in 2020 (20%). Wales saw the biggest change in the
number of vacant units, with vacancy rates rising 2.6% between 2019–

In terms of types of store, comparison goods stores (this means stores
selling fashion and household items for example, as opposed to
groceries and convenience stores) have consistently had far higher rates
of vacancies compared to other types of stores.38
Chain stores (brands with more than 5 outlets) have had a consistently
higher vacancy rate than independent stores and have seen a higher
rate of closures during the pandemic, shown in the chart below.

The Local Data Company and PwC reported that in 2020, chain
businesses had a 29% fall in the number of occupied units (net loss of
9,877 units), driven largely by very low numbers of new openings. For
independents on the other hand, 2020 saw a slowing of store closures;
the number of occupied units increased by 5% in 2020, although still
representing a net loss of 1,422 units.40 The LDC said this suggests that
the government support schemes (see Box 1) have been more effective
in supporting smaller businesses rather than larger chains, which have
moved to rationalise.

3.4 Changing consumer behaviour
Physical shops, high streets and shopping centres have adapted to the
rise of internet retailing by changing the experiences and services that
they offer to customers. This can be seen in several broad trends.
Click and collect and omnichannel retailing has grown. Online
retailing has not resulted in a simple substitution of physical shopping
for online shopping, although this has happened to some extent.
Instead, successful physical stores have developed online services that
are complimentary to their physical presence. Modifications include
offering customers the option to browse goods in the store and then
order them online, or pick up goods they have bought online in physical
stores.42
The growth of online retail following the pandemic is forcing retailers to
reconsider the value and purpose of their physical stores even further.
43
Commentators point to evidence that consumers are becoming less
brand-driven and more price-driven, with consumers not necessarily
sticking to their favoured brands when moving online.44 For example,
prior to the pandemic, John Lewis estimated that their physical stores
contributed around £6 of every £10 spent online; since the pandemic
that has been reassessed to on average around £3.45 Retailers are
increasingly moving towards shops that provide experiences and services
that cannot be sourced online (such as stylists, repairs, cafes) rather than
simply browsing space.46 Larger stores are moving to ‘inventory-less’
small-format stores.47 For example, John Lewis is trialling featuring John
Lewis shopping areas in Waitrose stores and smaller, neighbourhood
shop formats.48
The increasing popularity of beauty or personal service shops further
highlights this trend, signalling the type of service that customers value
that is not found online. The Local Data Company reports that in 2017,
most retail sectors saw a net fall in the number of units across the
country. But barbers, beauty salons and nail bars all saw net increases in
the number of units.49 In 2020, barbers again saw the highest number

of new openings for the 4th consecutive year despite the impact of the
pandemic.50
Convenience stores also made the top 10 list of growing stores in 2020
(growth by net change in the number of units) after 4 years of decline,
reflecting local shopping behaviours during the pandemic and their
status as ‘essential’ stores.51 Gyms also made the top-10 despite
pandemic closures, largely due to the number of independents in this
category and coinciding with a growing focus on health and
wellbeing.
52
There has been growth in mixed use malls which include shops,
cinemas and food and drink outlets. It has been argued that consumers
should not be analysed in terms of discreet purchases, but rather by the
trip they make to the shopping area.53 This is because increasingly, what
attracts people to the town centre or shopping mall is no longer just the
shops (which have often been substituted by online vendors), but rather
the leisure facilities that they can access there, such as cafes,
restaurants, cinemas and children’s activities.54 Shopping centres
however have been hardest hit during the pandemic in terms of store
vacancies (see section 3.3 above).
55
Retailers must also adapt to new consumer trends such as interest in
ethical and environmental sustainability of products and supply chains.56
3.5 Economic factors
In the decade following the financial crisis of 2008/09, average earnings
have been subdued and disposable income has barely grown. These
factors have affected confidence in the retail sector and contributed to
some of the recent trends in retailing mentioned above.
For much of the past decade since the financial crisis, earnings growth
has been below inflation, leading to a long period of stagnating wages
in real terms.
57 In conjunction, household disposable income has also
grown far more slowly than in previous decades, shown in the chart
below. Household disposable income means income after tax; it
includes wages as well as other sources of household income such as
pensions and investment.
Between 1955 and 2007, the average annual growth in real disposable
household income per head was 2.6% a year. Between 2008 and 2011

income recovered but at a slower rate (1.4% average annual growth).

These factors have fed into weak consumer confidence, particularly in
the five years following the financial crisis.59
Unsurprisingly consumer confidence fell at the onset of the pandemic in
March 2020. Confidence began to recover in early 2021 with the
vaccine programme accelerating and lockdown restrictions easing,
reaching pre-pandemic levels in May 2021.

services has been restricted.60 Together with rebounding consumer

3.6 Changing supermarket environment
Supermarkets are a fundamental component of the retail landscape in
the UK. They are where many people buy their food and other essential
items, they are innovative businesses that have transformed the retail
environment and, in some cases, they are also significant global brands.
But their role and position in the retail landscape has changed in recent
years.
The decade to 2012 was a period of rapid expansion for the big four
supermarkets (Tesco, Sainsbury, Asda and Morrison). These stores’
market share in groceries grew from around two thirds in 2000 to over
three quarters in 2011. This growth was accompanied by a number of
other features: broadening product ranges, more and larger stores
which were often located out of town, and increased multi-channel
retailing (including home delivery and click-and-collect).62
The five years since 2012 have seen many of these trends reversed. The
market share of the big four supermarkets has fallen from 77% in 2011
to 68% in 2018.63 The major supermarkets have also altered the profile
of their estates, with a concerted move away from out of town stores
towards town centre convenience stores and ‘small supermarkets’. In
2014, Sainsbury’s announced that it had more convenience stores than
supermarkets; Tesco, the UK’s largest retailer, announced that its
convenience stores outnumber its supermarkets in 2013.64
This decline in the market share of the big four was accompanied by the
rapid rise of the lower costs, “no frill” competitors: Lidl and Aldi. In
2008, the combined market share of Lidl and Aldi in the Great Britain
groceries market was 5%. In 2018 it was 13%.65 These stores are
characterised by a smaller range of goods and generally lower prices,
compared to the big four supermarkets.
Changing consumer behaviour has also affected the big four
supermarkets. In recent years, consumers have begun to make more
frequent, smaller value shopping trips. Consumer preference has shifted
in favour of single item purchases, rather than ‘multi-buys’. And, the
trend towards increased online purchasing means that a large stock
selection in store is no longer crucially important.66
