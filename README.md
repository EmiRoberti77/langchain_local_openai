to run this project you will need a Openai key

the full list of packages are in the requirements, probably some of them are not needed for this code but i experimented with extra ones.

this code need to be able to load data from a data directory

so place your files

- project
  --- data
  ------ data1.txt
  ------ data2.txt
  ------- data3.txt
  -- main.py
  -- constants.py
